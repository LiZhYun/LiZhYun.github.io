I am a doctoral student at the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, advised by [Prof. Lijun Wu](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Lijun-Wu-4). Before that, I received my B.S. in Computer Science and Technology from North China Electric Power University in 2015.

My research interest lies in artificial intelligence, multi-agent systems, and reinforcement learning. Previously, I conducted a one-year visit at the [Aalto Robot Learning Lab](https://rl.aalto.fi/) in Aalto University, advised by [Prof. Joni Pajarinen](https://people.aalto.fi/joni.pajarinen).

<!-- I will be graduated at July 2024 and open for postdoc position. -->
