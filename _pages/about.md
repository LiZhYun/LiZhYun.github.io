I am a fourth-year doctoral student at the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, advised by [Prof. Lijun Wu](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Lijun-Wu-4).

My research interest lies in (Multi-Agent) Reinforcement Learning. Previously, I primarily worked on cooperation among agents and application of MARL. I am currently conducting a one-year visit at the [Aalto Robot Learning Lab](https://rl.aalto.fi/) in Aalto University.

<!-- I will be graduated at July 2024 and open for job opportunity. -->
